# Daily Work Report Icon

Since we cannot create actual image files here, you should add an icon.png file to the static/description/ directory.

For now, the module will use a default Odoo icon. You can create a custom icon (128x128 pixels) and save it as:
/static/description/icon.png

The icon should represent daily work reporting - perhaps a calendar with checkmarks, a clipboard, or a time tracking symbol.
